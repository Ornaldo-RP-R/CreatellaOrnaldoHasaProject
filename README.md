Hello,

# How do i start the app?

Firstly use 'npm install' to install pacages then
By using 'npm start' it will run project(server on port 5000 and react in port 3000 automatically)

# Why is my code clean and readable?

First of all for this project i have used every part with a comment to let you know that what i have done is
100% mine not cpyied ,not by any friend or anything else.
Secondly i use structure in every project as you may see :
My main folders are :
-Api:I usually create a base for api and some helper functions
-Components:i make sure that everything is broken down to small parts easy to reach and understand
---About sturcture inside ->ComponentName.component.jsx file(for jsx or js (react component) logic) and ComponentName.styles.css(for styles)
-Pages:Are pages that the user will see every change of url makes another page(About sturcture inside ->ComponentName.jsx file(for jsx or js (react component) logic) and ComponentName.css(for styles))
-Redux:Keep small pieces and understandble one,keep track of small pieces inside State,each big piece (that has importance) is in different folder
---About structure inside I keep folders of state parts that are different like ex:Shop/Cart/Spinner/User etc
Each one usually 3-5 folders (.action(for exporting actions to be used for components action to be despatched)
.reducer(main reducer switch between functions) .types(keeping an object for not making errors of all types) .selectors(
i havent used in this project becouse is easy taking acess by just accesing by ex:state.shop.cartItem but selectors are used for performance and when you have big data on projct) .filterhelper(handling code clean if functions are big in reducer for ex tranforming something i keep it clean in different folder)
)
)
And other folders or files needed like for ex:photos/videos/App.js/App.css/Index.js/Index.css

# About reaching objective or full your request?

As far as i understand i have done mostly all requirement ,anyway for each project or web (mostly frontend) it is not just coding but even your design has importance on scoring and making you in a good level

# About design?

I have used simple elegant design fully responsive with not a lot of colours.
And something always ecommerce are well designed and looking good becouse of photos with ascii i could not give a great look,Images attract the user.

# I refered your request and have used low tools or plugins ?And why is that?

I fully understand you want to see my level of coding(js and css)/That s why i didnt use library like(Material Ui or Bootstrap) I did it by myself.Why used font-Awesome(i like it becouse using images makes page loads slowly and they give you exact icons with your preferences )

# About git

-One think out of requirement ,and i am sorry about that just i didnt read before project becouse its title was what should i do when i finish project.I usually make git regular commit but in this one i just commited at the end havent done regular commits.

Thank you and Hope to hear from you soon
